## API USAGE
***
The Weather-Forecast uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get the current weather. OpenWeatherMap API is free to use for smaller-scale applications. Large applications with bigger user bases may need to opt into one of the paid plans in order to satisfy the higher call–per-minute needs. The free tier comes with the following restrictions:
- 1,200 API calls per minute
- Weather history no greater than one day old
- 95% up time
- Weather data updates every 2 hours
- No SSL

If you need more calls per minute, increased up time, more frequent weather updates, or secured access, you’ll need to pay subscription. Regardless of which tier you decide to use, you need to register an API key for your application. To do this, register your application by signing up for an account. Once logged in, you can find the key under the setup tab. Since the API is public access, the key needs to be added as a parameter to whatever API endpoint you send a request to.
